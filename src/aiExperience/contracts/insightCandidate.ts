// To-Do Manager — local AI Experience candidate contract.
//
// Conforms semantically to the Gallery reference's canonical
// InsightCandidate<TFacts> (features/aiExperience/contracts/insightCandidate.ts
// in the Gallery repo: app, triggerId, priority, facts, messageTemplate,
// message, action, dedupeKey, sourceRecordId, evaluatedAt) but is this
// repo's OWN independently-typed definition — the completed Phase-2A design
// pass recommended Option C (a locally-owned, schema-conforming contract per
// repo) over a shared npm package, since no publish/versioning
// infrastructure exists anywhere in this ecosystem and there are only two
// trigger types to define in this first slice.
//
// Deliberately excludes every Gallery Pet-Dialogue-only field:
// `bypassEntryWalk` (CatMascot entry-walk animation gate — this repo has no
// mascot entry-walk), `autoCloseMs` (Welcome Fallback auto-dismiss timer —
// this is a persistent landing banner, not a timed popup), `userState`/
// `dialogueId`/`source`/`ruleVersion`/`expiresAt`/`ndTime` (Pet Dialogue
// backward-compatibility relics with no meaning here). Only the fields this
// local UI actually needs are present.
//
// `priority` is intentionally NOT typed as Gallery's `DialoguePriority`
// ('P0'|'P1'|'PROFILE'|'P2'|'LEGACY_INTRO'|'FALLBACK') — that enum encodes
// Gallery's own GLOBAL nine-tier cross-app ranking and importing it here
// would incorrectly imply these local candidates participate in it. This
// repo owns its own local-only severity scale.
