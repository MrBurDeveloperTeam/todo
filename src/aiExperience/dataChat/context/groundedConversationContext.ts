// Structured grounded-conversation memory for follow-up questions (see
// SNABBB-CROSS-APP-MOLAR-AI-CONVERSATIONAL-CONTINUITY-ENHANCEMENT).
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT the raw rendered assistant message — a follow-up like
// "which one should I do first?" must resolve against the STRUCTURED
// intent/dataset that produced the previous answer, never by re-parsing
// text. Holds no task titles/facts itself; a follow-up handler always
// re-resolves the same `lastIntent` against the CURRENT live `tasks`
// array (see resolveTodoFollowUp.ts), so an answer is always revalidated
// against present state, never a stale snapshot.
//
// LIFETIME: this file's own header previously assumed the adapter's
// `useMemo` deps in MolarAIFloat.jsx would give "account-switch isolation
// for free" purely from ordinary adapter recreation whenever `tasks`/
// `taskDataStatus`/`userContext` change — those change on nearly every
// task list refresh, so a closure-local `let groundedContext` was
// destroyed far more often than intended, breaking mid-conversation
// follow-ups. Host-owned (MolarAIFloat.jsx `useRef`) store instead, so the
// grounded context survives `createTodoMolarAdapter` being rebuilt on
// ordinary data refreshes — the same architecture already proven for
// Inventory and Appointment. Only the store's own `clear()` (wired to
// explicit reset + the identity-keyed remount boundary on MolarAIFloat,
// see App.tsx's `key={session.user.id}`) ever drops the context, never
// adapter recreation.
