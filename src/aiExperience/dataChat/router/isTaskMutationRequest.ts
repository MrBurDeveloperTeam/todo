// Deterministic guard against obvious task MUTATION requests reaching the
// existing General Chat pipeline during this read-only Phase-3 pilot.
//
// CONTEXT: the Phase-3 readiness pass found `MolarAIFloat.jsx`'s existing
// chat handler parses a fenced ` ```json ` block from the model's
// response and, if `window.__MOLAR_ACTIONS__` is set, dispatches
// `ADD_TASK`/`UPDATE_TASK`/`COMPLETE_TASK`/`DELETE_TASK` to it. That
// global is currently assigned NOWHERE in this repo — the mechanism is
// inert today — but it is still a live-looking, unused hook that could
// be wired later without anyone revisiting this exact file. This guard
// is implemented as defense-in-depth so Data-Driven Chat's read-only
// guarantee never depends on that dead code remaining dead forever; it
// does not modify or remove `window.__MOLAR_ACTIONS__` itself (a separate
// hygiene/security task).
//
// SAFETY DEFAULT: mirrors the final, browser-validated design from the
// sibling Inventory repo's Phase-3 pilot — a small, anchored
// INFORMATIONAL allowlist is checked first; otherwise, the presence of a
// recognized task-mutation operation verb/phrase ANYWHERE in the message
// intercepts it (default-deny), no imperative sentence structure or
// digit required.

/** Explanatory/mechanics questions — checked FIRST and exempted even if a
 *  mutation verb appears later in the same sentence. Deliberately narrow
 *  and anchored to the start of the message — never a bare question-word
 *  exemption. */
