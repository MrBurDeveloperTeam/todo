// Pure evaluator over the already-loaded `tasks` state. No task rows are
// ever produced by this provider — only aggregate counts, each derived
// from the exact same eligibility rules as the other three Data Chat
// providers (never a second, independently-drifting definition).
//
// `sourceRecordIds` is intentionally left EMPTY for Summary: including
// every open task's id would add payload size with no real traceability
// benefit for an aggregate answer (there is no single "the record this
// answer is about" the way a list intent has) — this mirrors the same
// decision already made for the sibling Inventory repo's Summary
// provider. `sourceRecordIds` is never sent to Gemini regardless (see
// ../contracts/groundedDataResult.ts), this is purely about whether the
// local result object itself carries the ids.
