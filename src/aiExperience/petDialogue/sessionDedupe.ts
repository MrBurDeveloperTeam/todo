// Phase-2B -> proactive Cat reminder: explicit, cross-tab, RELOAD-SURVIVING
// dismissal state only.
//
// CROSS-TAB "dismissed" state — localStorage, shared across all To-Do
// tabs on this origin. Written ONLY on an explicit user action: clicking
// Close or the reminder's CTA. Purpose: once the user has actually acted
// on the reminder in any one tab, no other already-open tab or
// later-opened tab — nor that SAME tab after a full reload — may show
// that same instance again.
//
// Merely DISPLAYING the reminder must never write this — only an explicit
// Close/CTA may. "Shown this activation, not yet explicitly handled"
// suppression is a SEPARATE, deliberately non-persisted concept — see
// CatMascot.jsx's own `shownCandidateKeysRef` (a plain in-memory
// `useRef(new Set())`, reset on every fresh mount) and
// selectDialogueCandidate.ts's `shownCandidateKeys` parameter. This file
// previously also exposed a sessionStorage-backed "seen this session"
// pair (`isDialogueSeenThisSession`/`markDialogueSeenThisSession`,
// composed via `isDialogueIneligible`) — that was removed (matching the
// browser-verified fix already applied in the Content Studio repo)
// because sessionStorage SURVIVES a same-tab full page reload (standard,
// spec'd browser behavior), so it was incorrectly suppressing a candidate
// the user had never actually Closed/CTA'd, on every subsequent reload.
// Persisted storage is the wrong layer for "don't reopen within this one
// mount"; only genuinely explicit handling belongs in storage that
// outlives the mount.
//
// Both are namespaced by BOTH the authenticated Supabase user id AND the
// candidate's own `dedupeKey`, so a different candidate instance (e.g. a
// different task id) is never suppressed by an unrelated dismissal, and
// account switching can never reuse another user's state.
//
// CROSS-TAB PROPAGATION: CatMascot.jsx's own `storage` listener recognizes
// when another tab wrote the exact key for the currently-visible candidate
// and suppresses it locally — WITHOUT writing localStorage again (the
// browser never fires `storage` in the tab that performed the write, only
// in every other tab, so there's no loop risk either way, but the
// listener still performs a local-only close since the key is already
// present in shared storage).
//
// SAME-APP ONLY: localStorage is origin-scoped. A dismissal here can
// never suppress the same reminder on a different Snabbb origin (e.g.
// app.snabbb.com's App Gallery, or another mini-app). True cross-app
// dismissal sync would require a shared backend/DB-backed dismissal
// table — a separate, larger feature, not attempted here.
