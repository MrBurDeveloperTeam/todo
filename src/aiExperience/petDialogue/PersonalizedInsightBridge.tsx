// Smallest bridge to get the already-resolved Phase-2A/2B InsightCandidate
// from Home.tsx (where useTodoPersonalizedInsight actually runs) across to
// CatMascot.jsx. Unlike Content Studio, Home and CatMascot are direct
// SIBLINGS already, both rendered from the same App.tsx return block — so
// this Provider simply wraps that existing fragment. No new Supabase query,
// no polling, no realtime — this is a pure read-only React Context relay of
// a value Home already computed. Mirrors the exact same three-way
// readiness contract already browser-validated in the E-Learning and
// Content Studio repos' own PersonalizedInsightBridge.tsx.
//
// THREE-WAY STATE: the context value is `PersonalizedInsightBridgeState |
// null`, where `null` specifically means "no publisher currently mounted"
// (off-Home route — this app doesn't have client-side routing away from
// Home while logged in today, but the contract stays symmetric with the
// other two apps regardless) — distinct from `{status:'not_ready'}`, which
// means "Home IS mounted and is actively telling us its Phase-2 source
// (tasks) is still resolving."
//
// READINESS SOURCE: App.tsx already owns an authoritative `TaskDataStatus`
// ('loading' | 'ready' | 'error') — the exact same signal already piped to
// MolarAIFloat for Phase-3 Data Chat's own readiness gate (see
// App.tsx's `taskDataStatus` state and resolveTodoDataQuery.ts's
// `taskDataStatus !== 'ready'` short-circuit). Home.tsx now receives this
// same status as a prop (previously only `tasks` was passed) and derives
// this bridge's not_ready/ready state from it — zero new query, reusing
// exactly the same state App.tsx already fetches/maintains.
//
// Deliberately route-scoped, not global: a non-`null` state only ever
// exists while Home is mounted and publishing (see
// usePublishPersonalizedInsight below, called only from Home.tsx).
