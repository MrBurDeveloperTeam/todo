/**
 * Dialogue-layer-only pool scan — mirrors the identical, already-hardened
 * App Gallery and Inventory pattern. Given a family's ORDERED candidate
 * pool (business ordering already applied by the provider — see e.g.
 * overdueHighTaskProvider.ts's evaluateOverdueHighTaskCandidates), returns
 * the first candidate that is neither already shown THIS MOUNT nor
 * explicitly dismissed for `userId`, or `null` if every candidate in the
 * pool is currently ineligible.
 *
 * `shownCandidateKeys` is the caller's own in-memory, mount-scoped
 * `Set<string>` (CatMascot.jsx's `shownCandidateKeysRef.current`) — never
 * persisted storage. This is what replaced the old sessionStorage-backed
 * "seen this session" mark: sessionStorage survives a same-tab reload, so
 * a candidate merely shown (never explicitly Closed/CTA'd) was being
 * incorrectly suppressed on every subsequent reload. A plain in-memory Set
 * naturally resets on every fresh mount (which a reload always is), so a
 * shown-only candidate correctly remains eligible again after F5, while
 * `isDialogueDismissed` (localStorage) continues to correctly suppress a
 * candidate the user actually Closed/CTA'd, across reloads and tabs.
 *
 * Deliberately lives here, not in any aiExperience/providers/*.ts or
 * aiExperience/resolver/*.ts file: those must stay
 * pure/deterministic/storage-independent, so all localStorage-aware
 * suppression is confined to this dialogue-only helper plus
 * sessionDedupe.ts — providers never see `shownCandidateKeys` either.
